# BlastGateServo
Blast gate servo controller for Arduino

 *   Allows a single push button to switch between different blast gates, with only a single one open at a time.
 *   Currently open blast gate is indicated by an LED.
 *   
 *   Requires:  A servo for each blast gate, one button
 *   Optional: An LED for each blast gate
 *   
 *   In the future I plan on adding an option to automate this based on detected AC current from the tool
 *   (if my sensor ever shows up)
